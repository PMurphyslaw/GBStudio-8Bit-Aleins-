This is an 8-Bit 2D Side-Scroller game created in <a href=https://www.gbstudio.dev/>GB Studio</a>. 
The game is based on the provided 2D Side Scroller named, "SpaceBattle".

Using GB Studio allowed me to find its' and my limitations if nothing else. 
I chose GB Studio as since it was advertised as the lowest impact game creator that would run locally on my system.
Not that it mattered as my fossil of a laptop, (A 2013 non-upgradable ThinkPad) who doesn't want to compile half the time anyways.
Use the levels as starters for your own games or take the backgrounds and sprites.

I'll be honest, this game probably could have been better put together. 
On one Map there are 10 actors too many and I just left it like that.
I used Ms Paint instead of an online editor and I really don't regret that either.


GB Studio itself is licensed under MIT Open Source license.

Here are ten levels of

So you have a analogue Pocket you want to play this game on? SWEET!

The Analogue Pocket recognizes GB Studio titles as proper Game Boy releases.
Create a new folder at the root of a FAT32-formatted MicroSD card and name it GB Studio.
If a .pocket file is not included with the game:
Download GB Studio for free, open the game’s .gbsproj file, use the top navigation bar to select 
Game > Export As > Pocket File, and wait for the project to compile and export.
Copy the .pocket file into the GB Studio folder on the MicroSD
Insert the MicroSD card into the Analogue Pocket
Power on the handheld and press the Analogue button to open the OS menu
Navigate to Tools > GB Studio > Play Creations and boot the game you’d like to play

Follow this link to have someone who gets more Ad referals than I do, explain it.
